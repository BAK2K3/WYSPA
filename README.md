# Overview

**Wyspa** is an anonymous social media network, designed to inspire self-expression; it encourages the acknowledgement of, and engagement with, other posts to increase their visibility. All posts have user-determined expiry dates, and can be viewed on a global map, based on their scrambled geolocation.

The project was developed using **HTML** , **CSS** , **JavaScript** , and **Python** , and utilises a NoSQL document-based database via **MongoDB**.
