<p><strong>Visualise Wyspas from around the world</strong></p>

<p>
  Each Wyspa has it's geolocation scrambled before being projected onto the
  world map, and given a user can choose how precisely to record their location,
  there is no way to truly identify who submitted the Wyspa, or where they are
  from.
</p>

<p>
  Each Wyspa is coloured based on the mood set out by the user on submission.
  The size of the Wyspa is calculated based on how many people have acknowledged
  they've listened to it.
</p>

<p>
  You can interact with any Wyspa, and it will take you directly to the message.
  From there you can read, listen to, and comment on it.
  <strong>Remember</strong> - If you read a Wyspa and you want it to be noticed,
  acknowledge you've listened to it so more people are likely to hear it!
</p>
