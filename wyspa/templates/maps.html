<p><strong>Visualise Wyspas from around the world</strong></p>

<p>
  Each <strong>Wyspa</strong> has its geolocation scrambled before being
  projected onto the world map, and given a user can choose how precisely to
  record their location, there is no way to truly identify who submitted the
  <strong>Wyspa</strong>, or where they are from.
</p>

<p>
  Each <strong>Wyspa</strong> is coloured based on the <strong>mood</strong> set
  out by the user on submission. The size of the <strong>Wyspa</strong> is
  calculated based on how many people have <strong>listened</strong> to it.
</p>

<p>
  You can interact with any Wyspa, and it will take you directly to the message.
  From there you can read, listen to, and comment on it.
  <strong>Remember</strong> - If you read a Wyspa and you want it to be noticed,
  acknowledge you've listened to it so more people are likely to hear it!
</p>
